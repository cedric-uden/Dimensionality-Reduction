\subsubsection{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Important as modern PCA algorithms are basically a statistical application of \gls{svd}
	\item Modern PCA is basically an applied version of SVD on a centered data matrix
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Minka's method to approximate intrinsic dimension}

\begin{itemize}
	\item scikit-learn implemented this version \cite{minka2000automatic} to guess the output dimesionality. 
	\item \cite{halko2011finding} is used to decompose the input matrix.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{ARPACK / truncated SVD}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite{wright2001large} ARPACK approach from scikit
	\item NOT for sparse data, not reviewed here (\href{https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html}{scikit})
