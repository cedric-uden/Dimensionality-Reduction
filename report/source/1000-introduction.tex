\begin{itemize}
	\item Like many other multivariate methods, it was not widely used until the rise of computers. 
	It is now well entrenched in most statistical applications. \cite{Jolliffe2002book}
	\item We will explore how to transform a large dimensional datasets into its \gls{intrinsicDimension} consisting of \glspl{latentVariable}
	\item We will take a look at different algorithms, their benefits and fallacies as well as their implementation
	\item Increase intepretability while minimizing information loss \cite{jolliffe2016principal}
	\item Has been used and reinvented multiple times in many different disciplines \cite{jolliffe2016principal}
