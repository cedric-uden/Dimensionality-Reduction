\acrlong{dr} is an important tool for data scientists to use when handling ever growing data sets that we encouter more and more frequently on a frequent basis.
\bigskip


Over the course of this work we have gotten familiar with the problems that \gls{dr} tries to solve and gained a rough understanding of its mathematical background.
This knowledge was then expanded to relate to their implementation in \gls{scikit}.
Finally, we have gotten accustomed to the applications of \gls{pca} and gained valuable insights in the field of \acrlong{dr}.
\bigskip


As mentioned in the introduction, this has been a brief overview of the difficulties that occur on this journey.
The subject is under constant development to this day and we are excited to witness its evolution in the upcoming years.
% \item Compare the application scopes
% \item Talk about how important it is for a data scientist to know these patterns
% \item Compare runtime complexity, which need to be accounted for to plan feasible projects
