In this section, we will compare the general solution approaches available which can be utilised to solve both linear as well as non-linear problems. \cite{HandsOnMLCh8}

\paragraph{Projection} In contrast, this is the trivial concept of the two. The idea is to project the data points onto a \gls{hyperplane} which summarises the data with as little information loss as possible.

Figure \ref{fig:projectionExample} illustrates this in a simple example.
As we can observe, when we pick the right \gls{hyperplane}, such as the x axis in the example, we lose far fewer information than if we would have picked the y axis.


\paragraph{Manifolds} This concept is significantly more difficult to get a hold of.
Significant breakthroughs \cite{ma2012manifold} in this field were accomplished in the year 2000 in the significant and commonly cited paper \emph{A global geometric framework for nonlinear dimensionality reduction}. \cite{tenenbaum2000global}
To understand the basic idea, we will demonstrate its behaviour to get an idea of the problem using the popular swiss roll data set pictured in figure \ref{fig:swissrollfull}.

Before demystifying this problem, we will then dive into various methods how to bend and twist high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional spaces.

Our goal is to avoid confusing projections such as shown in figure \ref{fig:swissrollprojection}:
