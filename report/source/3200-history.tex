\Gls{pca} has induced a fluctuating history during the span of the past century.
First appearances date back as early as the beginning of the $19^{\text{th}}$ century. 
During this time, the method has underwent several iterations while being reinvented multiple times across different disciplines \cite{jolliffe2016principal}.


\begin{itemize}
	% \item Good overview by \cite{jolliffe2016principal}
	\item First approaches made in 1901 using simple projections. \cite{pearson1901liii} (united kingdom)

	Jolliffe book section 3.2 - linear regression approach (p.34)
	\item Independently came \cite{hotelling1933analysis} in 1933 (east coast, Princeton) 

	Similar approach to Lagrange multipliers and ending in an eigenvalue / eigenvector problem. (Jolliffe book section 1.2 - p.7)
	\item Computationally feasible until much later

	% \item Has been used and reinvented multiple times in many different disciplines \cite{jolliffe2016principal}
