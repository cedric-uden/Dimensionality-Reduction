To round up the section on the \acrlong{pca}, we will look at its applications, of the \acrlong{svd}.
This way we will get a feeling of possible use-cases and additionally highlight some of their pitfalls.

We will first look at commercial applications that we know to relate to the practicability of \gls{pca}.
Following this, we will see how it can help us to visualise high dimensional data structures.
Then we will look at its applications in the field of computer vision.
Therefore, we will first look at how to compress data sets in a visual example and then visualise how \gls{pca} is used in human face recognition.

Finally, we will raise the awareness of potential pitfalls in \gls{pca} by walking through common mistakes that can be made.
