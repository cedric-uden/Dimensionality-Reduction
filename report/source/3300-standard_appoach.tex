\subsubsection{Projection}



Projection can either be considered as an approach in its own or as a simple interpretation of the geometrical idea behing \gls{pca} in general.
The idea is to project the data points onto a \gls{hyperplane} which summarises the data with as little information loss as possible.
This newly defined hyperplane can then be considered a principal component of the data set.

    \label{fig:projectionExample}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:projectionExample} illustrates this in a toy example.
As we can observe, when we pick the right \gls{hyperplane}, such as the x axis shown above, we lose far fewer information than if we would have picked the y axis.\bigskip


As one might be inclined to think the idea strongly ressembles to a regression problem. 
\citeauthor{tarpey1999self} elaborates this idea thoroughly in his paper \citetitle{tarpey1999self} \cite{tarpey1999self}.
\citeauthor{tarpey1999self} ends his work by proposing a test for the determined ``self-consistency'' of a principal component.


% \item \cite{tarpey1999self} has good approaches to get behind the idea of projection
% \item minimizing the distance of orthogonal projections hints to the first principal component
% \item Geometric interpretation of the problem 
% \item Is a regression problem \cite{brunton2019data} (1.4)

\subsubsection{Covariance Matrix}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Correlation Matrix is the normalized version of the Covariance Matrix (sort of)
	\item Mentioned by \cite{jolliffe2016principal} in Section 2 (a)
	\item Good contrast between the two by \cite{Jolliffe2002book} in section 3.3
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Lagrange Multipliers}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mentioned by \cite{jolliffe2016principal} in Section 2 (a)
	\item more details in introduction chapter in \cite{Jolliffe2002book}
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
	S \cdot a - \lambda \cdot a &= 0 \\
	\Leftrightarrow S \cdot a &= \lambda \cdot a
