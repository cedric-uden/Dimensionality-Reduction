\subsubsection{Projection}


% taken from ch 8 in g√©ron's book

In this section, we will compare the general solution approaches available which can be utilised to solve both linear as well as non-linear problems. \cite{HandsOnMLCh8}

\todo{Not quite true, revisit this. \cite{Lee2007NonlinearDR} cite this.}

\paragraph{Projection} In contrast, this is the trivial concept of the two. The idea is to project the data points onto a \gls{hyperplane} which summarises the data with as little information loss as possible.

Figure \ref{fig:projectionExample} illustrates this in a simple example.
As we can observe, when we pick the right \gls{hyperplane}, such as the x axis in the example, we lose far fewer information than if we would have picked the y axis.



\begin{itemize}
	\item \cite{tarpey1999self} has good approaches to get behind the idea of projection
	\item minimizing the distance of orthogonal projections hints to the first principal component
	\item Geometric interpretation of the problem 
	\item Is a regression problem \cite{brunton2019data} (1.4)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Covariance Matrix}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Correlation Matrix is the normalized version of the Covariance Matrix (sort of)
	\item Mentioned by \cite{jolliffe2016principal} in Section 2 (a)
	\item Good contrast between the two by \cite{Jolliffe2002book} in section 3.3
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Lagrange Multipliers}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Mentioned by \cite{jolliffe2016principal} in Section 2 (a)
	\item more details in introduction chapter in \cite{Jolliffe2002book}
\end{itemize}

\begin{align}
	S \cdot a - \lambda \cdot a &= 0 \\
	\Leftrightarrow S \cdot a &= \lambda \cdot a
\end{align}

\subsubsection{Eigendecomposition}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Looks like a good wrapup: \cite{abdi2007eigen}
\end{itemize}
