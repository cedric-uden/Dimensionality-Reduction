\subsubsection{Missaligned Data}

\cite{brunton2019data} (section 1.7)

\begin{itemize}
	\item Showcase Eigenfaces with rotation
	\item only few images ruin the batch
	\item the dataset was meticulously centered and optimized by hand for a proof of concept
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Too broad singular values}

First principal components might be too general and not \cite{brunton2019data} (section 1.6 - last figure)

\begin{itemize}
	\item Showcase Eigenfaces distribution of the images
	\item 5 and 6 work great
	\item others ruin all the information
	\item all the vertices are one picture of a person
	\item taken with various facial expressions and very different lighting settings
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Different units}

Different units WITHIN THE MATRIX... \cite{Jolliffe2002book} (Section 2.3 page 22)

\begin{itemize}
	\item relevant for ALL the values
	\item bigger numbers become dominant no matter what
	\item example car data set. I thought I was being smart... NOPE
\end{itemize}
