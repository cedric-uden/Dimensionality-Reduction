\subsubsection{Misaligned Data}


\begin{wrapfigure}[14]{r}{0.5\textwidth}

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{external_content/media/rotation/average_face-rotation.png}
    \captionsetup{justification=centering}
    \caption{Misaligned eigenface}
    \label{fig:misalignedEigenface}
\end{wrapfigure}

One major problem with \gls{pca} as well as the \gls{svd} is that the units of the data on all axes as well as its alignment significantly impacts the resulting approximation \cite{brunton2019data}.
The demonstration of the eigenfaces solely showcased decent results because the faces have been meticulously centered and cropped manually prior to the evaluation.
The impact can be observed in the adjoining figure \ref{fig:misalignedEigenface}.

To demonstrate the issues, 190 of the 2282 faces have been rotated by 10\textdegree\ prior to the \gls{svd}.
This shows that a mere 8\% is enough to obfuscate the analysis.


% \cite{brunton2019data} (section 1.7)

% \item Showcase Eigenfaces with rotation
% \item only few images ruin the batch
% \item the dataset was meticulously centered and optimized by hand for a proof of concept


\subsubsection{Different units}

    \captionsetup{justification=centering}
    \caption{Unit mismatch}
    \label{fig:unitMismatch}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Now we want to showcase what happens when \gls{pca} is applied on a data set with unrelated units.
This examination is based on a \href{https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=Car+details+v3.csv}{vehicle data set} with which we tried to identify patterns in terms of final selling price.
As we can see in figure \ref{fig:unitMismatch}, the graph hardly expresses any useful information.


% Different units WITHIN THE MATRIX... \cite{Jolliffe2002book} (Section 2.3 page 22)

% \item relevant for ALL the values
% \item bigger numbers become dominant no matter what
% \item example car data set. I thought I was being smart... NOPE

\subsubsection{Too broad singular values}

\end{center}

First principal components might be too general and not \cite{brunton2019data} (section 1.6 - last figure)

\begin{itemize}
	\item Showcase Eigenfaces distribution of the images
	\item 5 and 6 work great
	\item others ruin all the information
	\item all the vertices are one picture of a person
	\item taken with various facial expressions and very different lighting settings
\end{itemize}
