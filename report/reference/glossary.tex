% \gls{ } : This command prints the term in lowercase characters. For example, \gls{glsy} will print glossary.
% \Gls{ } : This is similar to \gls{ } command. The only difference is it will print the first character in the uppercase For example, \Gls{glsy} will print Glossary.
% \glspl{ } : This command is similar to \gls{ }. The only difference is that it will convert the term into its plural form.
% \Glspl{ } : This command is similar to \Gls{ } command, with the difference that it will convert the term in its plural also.
